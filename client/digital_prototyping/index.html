                        The UMD Mental Health Assistance System will replace the
                        old behavioral health services provided by our client:
                        the University of Maryland Health Center. It will
                        provide 24- hour-a-day services to general students,
                        especially to support freshmen students seeking mental
                        health assistance. This service includes online mental
                        health assistance for those who want to have an
                        anonymous setting, for those seeking other resources,
                        and for those who would like to meet outside of the UMD
                        Health Center. The new system includes anonymous
                        chatting, appointment scheduler, opportunity to meet
                        outside of the health center, and VR meetings for those
                        who live away from the campus and can’t commute to get
                        assistance. The new design will be more inclusive of
                        disabled students who wish to seek mental health
                        treatment; our design will include various features, for
                        example, a video with clear audio and subtitles to
                        discuss treatment methods and processes to provide clear
                        guidance. Furthermore, to acknowledge students of our
                        existence, we will send weekly emails to students to
                        seek our services if they are suffering from mental
                        health disorders. Overall, previous behavioral health
                        services failed to provide a variety of options,
                        resulting in extensive waiting time and avoidance in
                        seeking treatment. Compared to behavioral health
                        services, our system will provide a variety of options
                        to encourage students to seek mental health assistance
                        comfortably. We will implement a UX solution that guides
                        and encourages our users, primarily freshmen students,
                        who experience mental health issues to seek our system

                            The change that we’ve made to our new design is that
                            our team included upcoming appointments on the home
                            page. This way, without having to go to the
                            appointment page, users will be able to see their
                            appointment status from the home page. This design
                            change will remind users of their approved
                            appointment time and date; it will be much easier to
                            track down their appointment schedule. We’ve
                            implemented this design idea because one of our
                            participants mentioned that it will be a good idea
                            to add the appointment status on our home page so
                            users can check their appointment status more
                            easily. This was a takeaway from our most recent
                            user testing, where the user thought the original
                            design had too many words and the format was
                            cluttered, so we simplified it with our current
                            design.

                            On the first screen of the App, we've added an extra
                            choice from our original design. By placing them in
                            the Menu area, we've made it clearer what these
                            various services are. Another addition is the Home
                            section, which, as previously said, allows users to
                            keep track of their appointment schedule and reminds
                            them of their scheduled time and date. This takeaway
                            comes from our research into other apps that include
                            a menu option. Another reason we added a Menu area
                            was because our users wanted a means to check the
                            progress of their appointments, and this option
                            would be useful.

                            Although not much has changed from the previous
                            look, the user now has the option of changing the
                            font size. We reasoned that users with any type of
                            vision impairment could benefit from the font size
                            modification option. If a user is using the
                            anonymous chat late at night without their contacts
                            or glasses, they no longer need to be glued to the
                            screen to see the messages and can instead use the
                            new option. Following user testing, we can add a
                            read at (time) indication to the messages so that
                            the user can see that the anonymous messages they
                            are sending are being read and that they can assist.

                            Essentially the same as our previous design, with
                            the exception that we now have clear sentences for
                            our users, such as how to get started watching the
                            instructional video and a note at the bottom
                            informing them that the link they click will take
                            them somewhere else, to give them a heads-up on what
                            will happen if they click the link. This was a

                            from Part 1, in which the user suggested that having
                            a small note indicating what the link would do would
                            be helpful.

                            We made a significant improvement to our Schedule
                            Appointment menu in that our users can now schedule
                            their date and time at the same time. Previously,
                            the user had to select data from the calendar first,
                            then go to the time area to choose the time. Now
                            with the new design, users can select a date and
                            then, at the bottom of the calendar, a time option
                            that allows users to slide to any time that is
                            convenient for the appointment. This was a takeaway
                            from another user test, where the user thought it
                            would be easier to alter the date and time from the
                            same location rather than having to choose one after
                            the other.

                            and time for the mental health treatment, there
                            weren’t any confirmation messages that let users
                            know if their appointment was accepted or not.
                            Without this design change, users may submit
                            multiple appointments because they won’t have any
                            idea whether their appointment was accepted or not.
                            With the new design idea, when users confirm their
                            appointment, a confirmation page will pop up to let
                            users know that their appointment has been
                            successfully scheduled. This was a takeaway from
                            user testing; the user thought it would be nice to
                            have a confirmation page to let users know their
                            appointments have been successfully scheduled.

                            Our previous design didn’t provide users with enough
                            detail about the Meet Outside feature; it only
                            provided date, time, and location. Although the name
                            of the feature can be self-explanatory, users may
                            not know about this feature and disregard it. Now
                            with the new design, we provided an explanatory
                            statement about the Meet Outside feature to provide
                            enough detail to users who are not familiar with
                            this feature. Now for those who want to try a new
                            treatment feature, users know how to set up an
                            appointment to have a chance to meet with mental
                            health assistance outside of UMD health center. This
                            was a takeaway from one of our thinking aloud
                            evaluations from Part 1. The user recommended having
                            a leading page; however, we considered having an
                            explanatory statement because it was more concise
                            and straightforward to provide details about this
                            feature.
