                        The UMD Mental Health Assistance System will replace the
                        old behavioral health services provided by our client:
                        the University of Maryland Health Center. It will
                        provide 24-hour-a-day services to general students,
                        especially to support freshmen students seeking mental
                        health assistance. This service includes online mental
                        health assistance for those who want to have an
                        anonymous setting, for those seeking other resources,
                        and for those who would like to meet outside of the UMD
                        Health Center. The new system includes VR meetings,
                        chatting, scheduled, although short notice, meetings
                        outside of the health center, and video calls for those
                        who live away from the campus and can’t commute to get
                        assistance. The new design will be more inclusive of
                        disabled students who wish to seek mental health
                        treatment; our design will include various features, for
                        example, a video with clear audio and subtitles to
                        discuss treatment methods and processes to provide clear
                        guidance. Furthermore, to acknowledge students of our
                        existence, we will send weekly emails to students to
                        seek our services if they are suffering from mental
                        health disorders. Overall, previous behavioral health
                        services failed to provide a variety of options,
                        resulting in extensive waiting time and avoidance in
                        seeking treatment. Compared to behavioral health
                        services, our system will provide a variety of options
                        to encourage students to seek mental health assistance
                        comfortably. We will implement a UX solution that guides
                        and encourages our users, primarily freshmen students,
                        who experience mental health issues to seek our system.
                        The changes we’ve made are minor. We made changes to
                        some terminology to be more inclusive of those who need
                        mental health assistance. In an earlier version, we were
                        too narrow in our scope of the user by stating it was
                        for those with mental health disorders, but now we are
                        broadening our scope to include any student who needs
                        mental health assistance with our continued focus on
                        freshmen.

                        <img

                        <figcaption>
                            This sketch represents how a user will chat with a
                            professional at the health center. The user chats on
                            their device and the chat is sent to the server
                            where it is then sent to the health professional.
                            The health professional responds and the system
                            works the same but in reverse. This is an ecological
                            perspective because it shows how the user and health
                            professional chat over a network using their own
                            device.

                        <figcaption>
                            This sketch represents how a user can view the
                            resources available to them on the UMD Health Center
                            website for mental assistance. This is an ecological
                            perspective because it shows how the server is
                            holding the information, likely in a database, that
                            is shown to the user. The UMD Health Center can edit
                            these resources which are sent to the server and
                            provided to the user when they access the website.

                            This sketch is very similar to the first two. The
                            server here is different from the others in that it
                            must provide a constant connection and isn’t started
                            or stopped throughout the session. The user connects
                            to the server via their VR headset where they can
                            chat with a health professional who is also using a
                            VR headset connected to the server.

                                This sketch represents a user pressing the
                                button to start a chat on the UMD Health Center
                                website. This is an interaction perspective
                                because it shows how the user would interact
                                with the website to start a chat.

                                This sketch represents turning on/off a VR
                                headset and starting a new VR chat with a health
                                professional. The user can press the power
                                button to turn the VR headset on or off. Once
                                on, the wireless remote acts as a sort of mouse
                                that the user can move to start a new chat. This
                                is an interaction perspective because it shows
                                what the user would need to do in order to start
                                a new conversation.

                                on a bench. This QR code would take the user to
                                the UMD Health Center website and show them
                                available resources. This is an interaction
                                perspective because it shows how the user would
                                interact with their phone to scan the QR code
                                which would ultimately take them to the website.

                                This sketch represents a user who is stressed
                                about finals and making a mental health
                                appointment. Although the student is stressed,
                                they are happy that the website was easy to use
                                and that creating an appointment was very easy.
                                This is an emotional perspective because it
                                shows how the user is first stressed, and then a
                                little relieved after using the system to make
                                an appointment.

                                outside of the UMD Health Center. The user is
                                very happy about not having to go to the health
                                center. This is an emotional perspective because
                                it shows a user's emotions while using our
                                system to attend their session with a health
                                professional outside of the health center.

                                professional. The user is happy that they did
                                not have to reveal their identity to receive
                                mental health assistance. This is an emotional
                                perspective because it shows the users emotions
                                around using the anonymous chat feature of our

                            due to excessive stress from an overload of school
                            assignments. Since the student is busy, he doesn't
                            have time to go to the institution for his mental
                            instability; however, since there is a 24-hotline
                            feature for those who want to talk, he utilizes the
                            feature to talk about his current mental issues.

                            Furthermore, the kid is preoccupied with his
                            schoolwork and rarely has the opportunity to speak
                            with someone about his mental health. The student
                            however can now use the V.R chat option to talk to a
                            mental health specialist at the health center about
                            his concern.

                            challenges and difficulties in person. He realizes
                            that the UMD health center now has an anonymous chat
                            option for mental health assistance. He takes a
                            chance and uses the service and starts to have a
                            conversation with someone. He is very pleased with
                            the service at the end and gives his experience a

                    <p>
                        We’ve chosen these three storyboards to tell how our
                        system provides different features to help those who are
                        in different situations. The first storyboard shows a
                        student who suffers from mental instability but doesn’t
                        have time to seek treatment due to an overload of
                        schoolwork. Without having to go to the UMD health
                        center, the student was able to talk to health
                        professionals about his mental instability through a
                        24-hotline. The second storyboard shows a disabled
                        student who finds it difficult to obtain assistance from
                        the health faculty. By using the V.R chat option, now
                        the student could talk to a mental health specialist
                        without having to go to the health center. The third
                        storyboard shows a student who has problems with social
                        interaction. Without having to have face-to-face
                        counseling, he can talk to health professionals through
                        anonymous chat services. These differences in
                        storyboards are extremely important because they show
                        inclusive design capabilities to serve everyone
                        regardless of gender, physical limitations, or
                        preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The V.R chat options and the demonstration of the user
                        24-hotline chat where the user can seek therapy are two
                        ecological aspects that have made it into the
                        storyboard. The reason the V.R chat and 24-hotline chat
                        have an ecological perspective is because it shows how
                        the user and health professional chat over a network
                        using their own device. From an interaction standpoint,
                        we can see in the storyboard that the student used the
                        24-hotline when he was anxious and didn't have time to
                        physically go to the health center, so he engaged with
                        his phone to call the 24-hotline. In another storyline,
                        a crippled individual was unable to walk all the way to
                        the health facility for counseling, so he used the
                        virtual reality headset to receive his treatment.

                    <p>
                        Our group considered the user’s mental model by going
                        through the information that was collected through our
                        interviews and culminated into the personas we created.
                        This information showed us whether our user’s mental
                        model came from solely one perspective (ecological,
                        interaction, emotional) or if it was a mixture of all
                        three. The difference between the user’s mental model
                        and the designer's mental model is mainly that the
                        user’s mental model centered around the experience of
                        seeking mental health, while the designer’s mental model
                        centered on the features/services that would deliver
                        those experiences. With the user’s mental model in hand,
                        we were able to cater our initial plans for the
                        storyboards to address the unique needs of our users
                        through our created personas such as social interaction,
                        disability, and schedule constraints.
