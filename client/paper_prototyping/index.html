                        The UMD Mental Health Assistance System will replace the
                        old behavioral health services provided by our client:
                        the University of Maryland Health Center. It will
                        provide 24-hour-a-day services to general students,
                        especially to support freshmen students seeking mental
                        health assistance. This service includes online mental
                        health assistance for those who want to have an
                        anonymous setting, for those seeking other resources,
                        and for those who would like to meet outside of the UMD
                        Health Center. The new system includes anonymous
                        chatting, appointment scheduler, opportunity to meet
                        outside of the health center, and VR meetings for those
                        who live away from the campus and can’t commute to get
                        assistance. The new design will be more inclusive of
                        disabled students who wish to seek mental health
                        treatment; our design will include various features, for
                        example, a video with clear audio and subtitles to
                        discuss treatment methods and processes to provide clear
                        guidance. Furthermore, to acknowledge students of our
                        existence, we will send weekly emails to students to
                        seek our services if they are suffering from mental
                        health disorders. Overall, previous behavioral health
                        services failed to provide a variety of options,
                        resulting in extensive waiting time and avoidance in
                        seeking treatment. Compared to behavioral health
                        services, our system will provide a variety of options
                        to encourage students to seek mental health assistance
                        comfortably. We will implement a UX solution that guides
                        and encourages our users, primarily freshmen students,
                        who experience mental health issues to seek our system.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Anonymous Chat</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the main features that we have is an
                            anonymous chat function. This feature is essential
                            because many students avoid mental health treatment
                            due to fear of stigma. The stigma around mental
                            illness is a significant issue in our society;
                            seeking professional help for mental illness is seen
                            as weak and often followed by discrimination, a
                            substantial barricade for people to seek mental
                            health treatment (Borenstein, 2020). Thus, our
                            application provides an anonymous chat function to
                            prevent this issue. Without having to set up
                            appointments, students can easily find and talk to
                            professionals about their current mental illnesses.
                            Furthermore, our anonymous chat feature can be used
                            by any student without having to log into their
                            account; it will protect students' confidentiality
                            and ensure problem sharing is completely anonymous.

                        <h4>VR Meeting</h4>
                        <p>
                            VR (Virtual Reality) meeting feature simulates a
                            real space where patients can meet, talk, and
                            interact with mental health professionals. This
                            feature is essential since it provides students with
                            a virtual space where they can talk about their
                            illnesses without having to go to the UMD health
                            center. One of the main reasons students avoided
                            mental health treatment was lack of time (Czyz et
                            al., 2013). College students, especially freshman
                            students, are in an adjustment period, and they are
                            more likely to be overwhelmed with assignments. In
                            addition, trying to fit in additional commitment to
                            seek treatment causes even more stress for students.
                            Thus, our feature provides a virtual space where
                            students can interact with mental health
                            professionals for various treatments. Students will
                            be able to save significant time by excluding
                            traveling time. In addition, it will be economically
                            beneficial because students will be able to save
                            travel expenses.

                        <h4>Appointment Scheduler/Meet Outside</h4>
                        <p>
                            The appointment scheduler feature will provide
                            students with an opportunity to set up appointments
                            without having to go to the health center. With this
                            feature, students will be able to set up
                            appointments easily by logging in to our
                            application. When students create their accounts,
                            our system will ask for their personal information
                            and UID; thus, students do not have to type in
                            additional information when scheduling appointments.
                            Students will be able to easily schedule their
                            appointment because our system shows a calendar with
                            available dates and times. Another feature called
                            Meet Outside provides students with an opportunity
                            to seek mental health professionals outside of the
                            normal healthcare environment. It will provide
                            students comfort by selecting an environment where
                            students are familiar to interact with
                            professionals. Furthermore, walking meetings can
                            boost mental and physical health by improving
                            “self-perception and self-esteem, mood and sleep
                            quality, and it reduces stress and anxiety”

                        <p>
                            Another important feature that our system provides
                            is a 24-hour hotline. It is free and confidential
                            support for students in distress and experiencing
                            mental issues. It can be a good starting point where
                            students can obtain information, resources, and
                            support with mental health illnesses. With trained
                            professionals’ help, students will be able to reduce
                            the mental illness that they are suffering at the
                            moment. Also, since it is confidential and
                            anonymous, students won’t have any pressure talking
                            about the current issue that they are experiencing.
                            Furthermore, it will encourage students to seek
                            mental health treatment for those who have a
                            preference for self-management.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Participant 1</h4>
                        <h5>Thinking Aloud</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I really like the simple opening design for the
                                app. Although I feel like there is a lot to
                                read, the direction is very clear on where the
                                user should go for more information on the
                                health center option and how to get started.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I really like this part of the section because
                                all the different types of products provided by
                                the health center are here, such as the 24-hour
                                hotline, VR visit, and basic appointment.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I like the design for the anonymous chat; it's
                                very simple and is like the iMessages, so it is
                                very familiar to the user. There is no need for
                                them to get adjusted to the system; they can
                                start interacting and using this feature
                                care-free.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Okay, the VR Meeting might be a bit complicated
                                for me to understand because of different things
                                I would need to download first, but it's
                                definitely a great feature to have for people
                                who want to be there physically at the health
                                center but can't for various reasons. However, I
                                feel like some improvement can be made with the
                                instructions for the VR.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The page for a 24-hour outline, I like very
                                much. It's very simple, and with only one click
                                on the app, you are getting connected to the
                                call.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The schedule appointment page, I feel, could use
                                a bit more detail. I like that the day and time
                                are there and show how I will be choosing the
                                day and time in the calendar.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Participant 2</h4>
                        <h5>Thinking Aloud</h5>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                I like the fact that it's simple, but when I
                                think of the main page, the main thing required
                                is icons rather than sentences. I like the
                                second page; it is pretty straightforward, but
                                maybe including a help option will make it
                                easier.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Anonymous chat is very similar to any basic chat
                                message, and it is very easy to navigate. Also,
                                showing whether the doctor has read the message
                                or not and including timestamps at the end of
                                each message would help the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I like the VR option because it is very
                                straightforward. For the redirect, maybe having
                                a countdown for the redirect and having a back
                                option to go back just in case the user wants to
                                would be helpful.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I like the 24hour hotline; it's very simple, and
                                maybe having a disclaimer of information being
                                confidential would be nice to have for the user.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                More information on Meeting Outside, there
                                should be more options leading up to the Meeting
                                outside page. What if the user accidentally
                                clicked on it and it submits that? So, having a
                                page leading up to it would be helpful.
