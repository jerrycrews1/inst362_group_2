                    <p>
                        Regarding preparation for the interviews, our team
                        decided that we wanted to generate questions that were
                        focused on the freshman year experience. We came up with
                        these questions by cross-referencing them with Salma’s
                        tips on interviews. This was to make sure our questions
                        were letting the interviewee explain and not limit them
                        to binary or short responses. We practiced by answering
                        the questions ourselves, seeing if we were able to
                        provide thoughtful responses. We wanted to give our
                        interviewees the chance to express themselves fully
                        about what they felt during their first year of college.
                        This allows us to take a lot more into consideration
                        moving forward into the next phases of the UX design
                        process.

                    <h3>Report</h3>
                    <p>
                        Since our client is the UMD health center, we’ve focused
                        our observation around the UMD health center building
                        found on campus. Collectively, our group plans to
                        conduct multiple interviews in order to gain a better
                        understanding of the mental health problem at UMD. For
                        this report, however, we will focus on one interview in
                        particular with Joe. Joe is a senior Information Science
                        major. Joe opened up to us about the state of his mental
                        health during his freshman year. We’ve created
                        categories of waiting, navigation, general mood, type of
                        traveler, behavior, and age for our team's observational
                        guide. We focused on how long people waited around the
                        health center to get treated. Then we observed how
                        people navigated around the building, the general mood
                        of the people utilizing the health center, coming alone
                        or in pairs, behavior around the health center, and the
                        overall age group of people using the health center.

                    <h3>Observation notes</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you approach the health center, one thing that
                        stands out is that there is a large screening board
                        right in the road to the entrance, as if the health
                        center wants visitors to look at the screening before
                        entering. I stopped in front of the health facility and
                        read the screening board because I hadn't been there
                        since freshman year. From this little experience, I
                        concluded there is a high chance that someone who hasn’t
                        been to the health center in a while would stop and read
                        the screening board. From my observations, for 2 hours
                        most of the people who visited seemed to be aware of the
                        screening board because they went into the health center
                        without even giving the screening board a glance when
                        entering. There were a few people, like me, who checked
                        the screening board. Given how long they spent reading
                        the screening board, I believe they were a first-time
                        visitor. During my two hours, only once did a couple of
                        students enter the health center with bags and exit a
                        few minutes later without them, implying that they were
                        simply there to drop the bag. We also had a couple of
                        kids who ignored the screening board as if they just saw
                        the sign as irrelevant and went into the health center
                        but seconds later came out to read the screening board.
                        There have also been instances where students ignored
                        the screening board and instead sat on the benches in
                        front of the health center, checking their phones or
                        watches to see before going in, suggesting that they
                        might have made an appointment beforehand. Overall from
                        this observation, I would say that the majority of
                        traffic suggested that they knew about the screening,
                        suggesting that they somehow knew about the health
                        center and their current restrictions regarding getting
                        appointments or visitations.

                    <h3>Reflections</h3>
                    <p>
                        Overall, our contextual inquiry went as we planned. We
                        conducted interviews and observed UMD Health Center as
                        we planned. The division of work among our team members
                        allowed each member to focus on one task. Through our
                        observation, we got to see how people behaved and
                        utilized the health center. We were able to understand
                        their needs and overall tasks. Through our interviews,
                        we were able to obtain the mental state of students
                        during freshman year and how they dealt with those
                        issues. Although many more tasks are to be completed,
                        our team feels like we have a big picture understanding
                        of designing ideas for supporting UMD freshmen. If we
                        had time to do more interviews and observations, our
                        team would focus our interviews on freshmen students. It
                        would be helpful for us to understand their current
                        mental state and if freshmen students are aware of
                        support for mental health disorders. For the observation
                        site, we would observe where freshmen are commonly seen
                        to observe the overall mood of freshmen students to see
                        if they are stressed or anxious.
