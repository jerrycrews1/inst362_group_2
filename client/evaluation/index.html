                    <p>
                        To evaluate our design, our team decided to ask ten user
                        testers. We decided to include this many people because
                        our team's design will get a lot more feedback from
                        people with different information-seeking behaviors.
                        After interacting with our team's design features, they
                        will be able to point out flaws and points where they
                        had difficulty completing certain tasks. Our team
                        decided to recruit UMD students; to find suitable user
                        testers, our team went to a freshmen event in the Stamp
                        Student Center and asked our friend to recruit freshmen
                        and transfer students to test our team’s design. Since
                        our design is to help freshmen students seek the UMD
                        health center for mental health treatment, we mainly
                        recruited freshmen and transfer students who never had
                        prior university experiences. This evaluation aims to
                        find overall student experiences while interacting with
                        main design features, discover how long it takes for
                        students to complete a task from the main menu, design
                        flaws that confuse students, and innovative design ideas
                        to improve our team's design. The task that our team
                        will ask user testers to complete is navigating through
                        our main design features. For example, our team will ask
                        users to book appointments, download VR systems, chat
                        through the Anonymous Chat feature, navigate through the
                        Meet Outside feature, and call the 24-hour hotline.

                                    design evaluation.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I’d like to start by asking you some
                                    questions about who you are and your current
                                    grade. I will then ask you to perform some
                                    tasks on our new UMD’s behavioral health
                                    services application that is designed to
                                    help students.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Once the task is completed, I’d like to get
                                    some feedback on overall experiences with
                                    our application design. This is to get an
                                    overall evaluation of our application design
                                    from you, so your honest feedback is very
                                    important.
                                </p>

                                <p>Are there any questions before we start?</p>

                                    bit about yourself.

                                    Since previous behavioral health services
                                    failed to provide a variety of options,
                                    resulting in extensive waiting time and
                                    avoidance in seeking treatment, our product
                                    design will provide 24-hour-a-day services
                                    to general students, especially to support
                                    freshmen students seeking mental health
                                    assistance.

                                    The new system includes anonymous chatting,
                                    appointment scheduler, opportunity to meet
                                    outside of the health center, and VR
                                    meetings for those who live away from the
                                    campus and can’t commute to get assistance.

                                    Before we end this evaluation, did you like
                                    the overall layout of the application?

                                    Would you use this application if you
                                    experience mental health concerns while in
                                    school?

                <div>
                    <h2>Website Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>
                        Website Accessibility We were lucky enough to not have
                        any errors when using the WAVE tool. Jerry has developed
                        websites in the past and has used this tool each time so
                        he already knew what to do when developing the website.
                        There are drawbacks to utilizing a tool like WAVE
                        instead of testing on users with disabilities. Tools
                        like WAVE cannot catch every error every time. CSS plays
                        a huge role in how a website looks and that is not
                        always picked up by the WAVE tool. Javascript can also
                        affect the accessibility of a website that a disabled
                        user may notice while using the website but a tool like
                        WAVE may not. The biggest benefit to using a tool like
                        WAVE is that it helps reduce the time and cost of making
                        our website accessible. It is not always possible to
                        include disabled users and even if we do, we may not
                        include all different disabilities that users may have.
                        Using the WAVE tool can also be a great first step to
                        making a website accessible. Ensuring the website
                        doesn’t have any WAVE errors before implementing user
                        testing with users with disabilities can help speed up
                        the iteration process.
