                    <h3>Design Requirements Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        We discovered numerous interesting and thought-provoking
                        responses from our interviewers through our interviews
                        and work activity notes, which directed us in thinking
                        about many alternative possibilities for developing a
                        design. One thing we found fascinating is that the
                        interviewee provided so much good feedback on what the
                        health center could improve because they believe there
                        are many things the health center cannot provide for
                        them. One of the fascinating things we discovered was
                        that some interviewees preferred face-to-face
                        consultations over internet consultations. This
                        surprised us because we assumed that most people seeking
                        mental health advice would prefer an online platform
                        where they could consult from the comfort of their own
                        home or a secure location. One of the most difficult
                        aspects of this process, in my opinion, has been the
                        duplication of some of the answers we received from the
                        interviewers. Regardless of whether they are in their
                        freshman or senior year, or if they have transferred to
                        the school recently, the majority of the students appear
                        to have a similar difficulty with the health facility.
                        It restricts our ability to make significant adjustments
                        to the design. I believe one of the issues we
                        encountered as a group was determining the best way to
                        compose our work activity notes. Work activity notes are
                        critical to ensuring that we can distinguish between the
                        many distinct categories that our interviewees respond
                        to and that we can focus on the specific improvement
                        that our interviewees desire from the health center. As
                        a result, we had to double-check our work activity notes
                        process to ensure they were completed appropriately.

                    <p>
                        The UMD Mental Health Assistance System will replace the
                        old behavioral health services provided by our client:
                        the University of Maryland Health Center. It will
                        provide 24-hour-a-day services to general students,
                        specifically to support freshmen students suffering from
                        mental health disorders. This service includes online
                        mental health assistance for those who want to have an
                        anonymous setting. The new system includes chatting and
                        video calls for those who live away from the campus.
                        Setting appointments with mental health assistants will
                        also be available through our system for those who want
                        to have personal interaction. Furthermore, to
                        acknowledge students of our existence, we will send
                        weekly emails to students to seek our services if they
                        are suffering from mental health disorders. Overall,
                        previous behavioral health services failed to provide a
                        variety of options, resulting in extensive waiting time
                        and avoidance in seeking treatment. Compared to
                        behavioral health services, our system will provide a
                        variety of options to encourage students to seek mental
                        health assistance comfortably. We will implement a UX
                        solution that guides and encourages our users, freshmen
                        students, who experience mental health issues to seek
                        our system.

                    <p>
                        After doing this exercise, our team felt that there was
                        much more clarity regarding the key points of our
                        concept statement. Our system concentrates on the
                        aspects of mental health and the appropriate assistance
                        that our interviews and observations pointed towards.
                        This is especially true when it comes to face-to-face vs
                        an anonymous setting, which we found to be very divided
                        among students. Looking back at our previous statement,
                        we did not have enough detail and elaboration as to what
                        our system would specifically cater towards and why we
                        feel such things are necessary. Stemming from the
                        knowledge we now know, our concept statement is able to
                        include a wide variety of students, specifically
                        freshmen, and their own unique needs and their preferred
                        methods of communication and guidance.
