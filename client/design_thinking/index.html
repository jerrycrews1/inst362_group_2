                        The UMD Mental Health Assistance System will replace the
                        old behavioral health services provided by our client:
                        the University of Maryland Health Center. It will
                        provide 24-hour-a-day services to general students,
                        especially to support freshmen students suffering from
                        mental health disorders. This service includes online
                        mental health assistance for those who want to have an
                        anonymous setting. The new system includes chatting and
                        video calls for those who live away from the campus.
                        Setting appointments with mental health assistants will
                        also be available through our system for those who want
                        to have personal interaction. Furthermore, to
                        acknowledge students of our existence, we will send
                        weekly emails to students to seek our services if they
                        are suffering from mental health disorders. Overall,
                        previous behavioral health services failed to provide a
                        variety of options, resulting in extensive waiting time
                        and avoidance in seeking treatment. Compared to
                        behavioral health services, our system will provide a
                        variety of options to encourage students to seek mental
                        health assistance comfortably. We will implement a UX
                        solution that guides and encourages our users, freshmen
                        students, who experience mental health issues to seek
                        our system.

                        other members of the group checked over them. The
                        personas came from the groups of users we identified

                        <h4>Persona: Arham Ali</h4>
                        <p>
                            Arham Ali loves engineering and is fascinated by
                            aerospace so hence when he entered university of
                            Maryland he decided to pursue his degree in
                            aerospace engineering. He loves playing sports and
                            going to the gym. Unfortunately for him he got
                            injured playing sports and cannot walk long
                            distances and needs multiple teams if he is walking.
                            He is still able to work out and go to work so in
                            his free time he tries to occupy himself by taking
                            care of his body by going to the gym.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He loves making jokes in a social setting. Always
                            trying to create the best atmosphere and making sure
                            that everyone is happy. His strong personality in a
                            social setting sometimes backfires on him as it is
                            hard for him to talk about his problems and
                            stressful issues. He is active on most of his social
                            networks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Key characteristics include that Arham is Age 19-22.
                            Is very sociable and loves making jokes and making
                            sure that his friends are safe. Thinks of himself as
                            the oldest sibling of his friend group. His goals
                            include making sure that he is in very good
                            condition physically and emotionally. Making sure
                            that he graduates on time.

                        <h4>Scenario: Arham Ali</h4>
                        <p>
                            Arham Ali is a senior aeronautical engineering
                            student who transferred from another university to
                            the University of Maryland College Park. The
                            majority of his classes are on the north east side
                            of campus, which is home to all of the engineering
                            facilities. He lives in one of the flats near
                            college and goes to the gym during his free time and
                            when he is stressed. When he's weary and stressed,
                            he usually doesn't feel like going uphill to the
                            stamp or the health center due to his long term
                            injury and also because of how far it is from his
                            classes and the inaccessibility of buses to take him
                            to stamp. He would want to see an online mental
                            health session from the health center during such
                            days when he can’t make these trips to the health
                            center. He also finds it inconvenient that the
                            health center does not have information on where
                            else he can go on campus if he needed to talk about
                            his stress.

                    <h3>Ideation</h3>
                    <p>
                        This part of the project was really fun. We started by
                        brainstorming design ideas. We did this without any
                        critique and without any reservations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of ideas were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Freshman receive a class on mental health resources
                            during orientation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Students can use VR headsets to get mental health
                            assistance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Popup mental health centers around campus with QR
                            code to scan for help.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Sketches</h3>
                    <p>
                        We chose 10 of these ideas to turn into sketches. Some
                        of the sketches involved two or three ideas because they
                        were similar.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img
                            class="rotate"
                            src="/design_thinking/sketches/sketches_Page_10.png"
                            alt="sketch of a popup tent next to a sidewalk."
                        />
                        <figcaption>
                            This sketch is of a popup mental health resource
                            tent. This tent features some way for a student to
                            check in (QR code in our sketch). Students can
                            receive various forms of mental health resources
                            from this popup tent. We chose this sketch because
                            this idea can help spread the knowledge of what
                            resources are available to students on campus and
                            can provide a convenient way for students to get
                            those resources.
