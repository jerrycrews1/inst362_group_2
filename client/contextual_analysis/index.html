                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The motivation for the project is to better understand
                        and potentially encourage first-year students who are
                        struggling with mental health disorders to seek mental
                        health advisors. Freshman year is a challenging year for
                        many students since it is the first year they are away
                        from home or on their own. It is also an adjustment
                        period to the difficulties of balancing academic success
                        in college with a social life. According to the annual
                        Beginning College Survey of Student Engagement, they
                        found that "53 percent of first-year students reported a
                        substantial increase in mental and emotional exhaustion"
                        (Carrasco, 2021). Although Universitiesâ€™ Health Center
                        offers several links and phone numbers for freshmen to
                        use for mental health services, the majority of students
                        do not seek or receive treatment due to the perception
                        that treatment is not needed, lack of time, preference
                        for self-management, pragmatic barriers to accessing
                        services (long waiting period, financial concerns, not
                        knowing where to go), concerns about stigma and
                        discomfort related to discussing problems with
                        professionals, doubt that professional help would be
                        beneficial, and negative experiences with professional
                        help-seeking (Czyz et al., 2013). Our project will be to
                        understand how to better provide mental health services
                        to freshmen. Our client, UMD health officials, will
                        better understand the restrictions freshmen experience
                        when seeking mental health assistance through our
                        findings. Furthermore, with the help of the interviews
                        and observations, we will implement a UX solution that
                        guides and encourages our users, freshmen students, who
                        experience mental health issues to seek UMD health
                        officials.

                    <p>
                        The first major work role is of the freshman/transfer
                        students at UMD. Specifically, in our project, the work
                        role of the students we are interested in are those
                        seeking mental health assistance (or not seeking it
                        because of some reason other than not needing it). These
                        students are currently accomplishing their tasks several
                        ways. Some do not seek help from the official work roles
                        of counselors but instead turn to their friends for
                        assistance (I:P2). While we did not have friends in our
                        initial thought process, we have added it to the flow
                        model because of our interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second work role is that of friend. The friend, in
                        our diagram, provides support and assistance to the
                        student work role. We may require followup interviews to
                        better understand this work role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third work role is the UMD Counselor/Health Worker.
                        This work role provides mental health assistance to the
                        student in our diagram. This work role would not be able
                        to help assist the student without the UMD Health Center
                        and/or the UMD Counseling Center. The UMD
                        Counselor/Health Worker role also uses multiple UMD
                        websites to provide students with the information they
                        need to seek mental health assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We list Third-Party Health Workers very close to the UMD
                        Counselors/Health Workers. We do this because these
                        nodes are separate, but they perform similar functions.
                        They both provide mental health assistance to the
                        student, but the Third-Party Health Worker does not work
                        at the UMD Health Center/Counseling Center. This work
                        role is a resource that is provided on the UMD website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two entities that we have identified are the UMD
                        Health Center/Counseling Center and multiple UMD
                        websites. These entities facilitate the seeking and
                        providing of mental health assistance between the
                        student and the UMD Health Workers/Counselors.

                        Our contextual analysis helped us identify several key
                        categories. The first is the general mood and mental
                        health of the students during their freshman/first year
                        at the university. We were able to identify that several
                        of the students felt that the adjustment to college was
                        stressful and difficult. Every one of the students felt
                        stressed during their first semester.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next category we identified was the reasons for
                        stress that the students identified. There was a lot of
                        variety in the reasons for stress. One of the students
                        has a family and had a long commute to and from campus.
                        Another student had never needed to study before. The
                        theme that we identified here was that there are a lot
                        of reasons why students are stressed during their first
                        semester.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third category that became apparent was how the
                        interviewees dealt with their stress. Only one of our
                        interviewees had received some sort of mental health
                        counseling. This person received their counseling from
                        an off-campus resource. Interestingly, one of the
                        interviewees specifically stated that he liked to deal
                        with his stress on his own. This student stated that he
                        enjoyed the challenge. This was not something that we
                        expected to find throughout our interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next theme we identified was how familiar the
                        interviewees were with the resources available to them
                        on campus. Two students stated that they did not know
                        where to seek mental health assistance. Two others
                        stated that they were familiar with the resources
                        offered on campus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next theme was the interviewees willingness to seek
                        mental health assistance. Two of the students stated
                        that they would prefer face-to-face assistance if they
                        were to seek it. Another stated that they would seek
                        assistance if they knew it existed. We found a couple of
                        the notes specifically interesting. One of the
                        interviewees stated that they would not seek assistance
                        because it was at the health center. Another stated that
                        they would rather seek assistance in an online format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last theme we identified was the recommendations
                        that resulted from our interviews. There were a wide
                        variety of responses. One student stated they had no
                        recommendations for how the university could help
                        students. Some stated more sharing of the resources
                        would be helpful. Furthermore, students had difficulties
                        finding resources that they were looking for due to the
                        complexity of the UMD health center website layout.

                        One of the things we found interesting was the variety
                        of responses we received when we asked the interviewees
                        about their knowledge of resources available to them.
                        Because most of our group members are seniors, we are
                        very familiar with what resources are available. We were
                        very surprised to hear from two of the interviewees that
                        they were not familiar with the mental health resources
                        that the university provides. This made us stop and take
                        a step back. We thought that our problem was that
                        students were stressed but did not want to receive
                        mental health assistance from the university for
                        whatever reason (our goal was to find this reason).
                        Understanding that some of the students arenâ€™t familiar
                        with the resources at all poses a different problem.
                        Back to the variety of responses, some of our
                        interviewees were very familiar with the resources
                        available. They cited having received emails informing
                        them of how they could seek mental health assistance.

                        Another thing that we discovered throughout the
                        contextual analysis process that was surprising to us
                        was the different reasons the interviewees stated they
                        might not seek mental health assistance on campus. One
                        student stated that he thought of solving his own mental
                        health concerns as a personal challenge. This same
                        student stated that he would likely seek professional
                        assistance if he did not believe he could handle his
                        concerts on his own. Another student stated that they
                        would not seek assistance on campus because it was
                        located at the health center. We had not considered the
                        physical location of the health center to be a potential
                        reason students were not seeking mental health
                        assistance.

                    <p>
                        Overall, our contextual inquiry went as we planned. We
                        conducted interviews and observed UMD Health Center as
                        we planned. The division of work among our team members
                        allowed each member to focus on one task. Through our
                        observation, we got to see how people behaved and
                        utilized the health center. We were able to understand
                        their needs and overall tasks. Through our interviews,
                        we were able to obtain the mental state of students
                        during freshman year and how they dealt with those
                        issues. Although many more tasks are to be completed,
                        our team feels like we have a big picture understanding
                        of designing ideas for supporting UMD freshmen. If we
                        had time to do more interviews and observations, our
                        team would focus our interviews on freshmen students. It
                        would be helpful for us to understand their current
                        mental state and if freshmen students are aware of
                        support for mental health disorders. For the observation
                        site, we would observe where freshmen are commonly seen
                        to observe the overall mood of freshmen students to see
                        if they are stressed or anxious.
